<!-- This is a placeholder PNG file. In a real project, you would convert the SVG to PNG using a tool like:
- Online converter (https://convertio.co/it/svg-png/)
- Adobe Illustrator
- Inkscape
- Command line tools (rsvg-convert)

For now, we'll use the existing favicon.png as a temporary placeholder -->
